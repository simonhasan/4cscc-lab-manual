# Comments

Comments in programming languages are like silent narrators, providing insight and clarity to the code without actually being executed. These annotations serve as textual explanations or reminders within the source code, aiding developers in understanding, maintaining, and collaborating on software projects. Comments can range from simple explanations of code logic to detailed documentation of complex algorithms. Comments can also be used to annotate code to



```python
# This is a comment.
```



```python
# This is a single-lined comment.

'''
This 
is 
a 
multi-lined
comment
'''
```



```
print('')
#print('')
```
