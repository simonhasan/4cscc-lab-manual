# Breadboards

A **breadboard** is a tool used in electronics for prototyping circuits without soldering, providing a convenient way to connect and disconnect components quickly.

A breadboard consists of a grid of interconnected metal clips beneath a plastic surface, allowing electronic components to be inserted into the holes on the surface and connected together without soldering. When components like resistors, LEDs, or wires are inserted into the holes, their metal leads make contact with the metal clips underneath, creating electrical connections. This enables users to quickly and easily prototype circuits by placing components on the breadboard and connecting them together to create functional electronic circuits.
