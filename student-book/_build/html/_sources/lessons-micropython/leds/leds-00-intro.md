# Introduction to LEDs

**Light-emitting diodes**, or LEDs, are tiny electronic devices that have transformed how we illuminate and interact with the world around us. Unlike traditional incandescent bulbs, LEDs generate light through **electroluminescence**, where electrons pass through a **semiconductor** material, releasing energy in the form of light.

With their small size, efficiency, and durability, LEDs have become the go-to choice for a wide array of applications. From lighting up homes and offices to illuminating smartphones and televisions.
