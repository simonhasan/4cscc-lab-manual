# Light-emitting Diodes (LEDs)

As mentioned in the introduction, **light-emitting diode (LED)** is a semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current passes through it, commonly used in various electronic displays and lighting applications.

## Parts of an LED

TODO:EXPLAIN THE PARTS

In an LED, the anode and cathode are the two terminals through which electricity flows to make the LED emit light. 

The anode is the **positive terminal**, connected to the longer leg of the LED (usually indicated by a notch on the LED casing).

The cathode is the **negative terminal**, connected to the shorter leg (usually indicated by a flat edge on the LED casing).

## Checkpoint: Anode or Cathode

Which lead is the anode? Which lead is the cathode? What is the polarity of the different leads?

**A** has the flat side and the shorter lead so it is the **cathode**. The polarity is **negative**.<br>
**B** has the longer lead so it is the **anode**. The polarity is **positive**.
