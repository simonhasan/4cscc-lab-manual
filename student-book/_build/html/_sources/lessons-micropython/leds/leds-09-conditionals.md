# Conditional Statements

**Conditional statements** in Python are programming constructs that allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether certain conditions are `True` or `False`.  They are used to make decisions in code, allowing programs to choose between different actions based on certain conditions being met or not. In essence, conditional statements are used to control the flow of programs.



## `if` Statements

In Python, an `if` statement is a conditional statement that allows executing a code block only if a specified condition evaluates to `True`. It is the most basic form of conditional execution in Python. 

The syntax of an `if` statement typically consists of the keyword `if`, followed by a condition, and a colon `:`. A code block of one or more statements is executed if the condition is `True`. The code block is indented underneath the `if` statement with four spaces.

```
if <condition>:
    <statement>
    <statement>
```

## `if`...`else` Statements

An `if`...`else` statement is a conditional statement that allows you to execute one block of code if a specified condition evaluates to `True`, and a different block of code if the condition evaluates to `False. It provides a way to create branches in the flow of execution based on the outcome of a condition.

The syntax is identical to an `if` statement  Optionally, the "if" statement can be followed by an "else" statement, which contains another code block to be executed if the condition is false.

```python
if <condition>:
    <statement>
    <statement>
elif:
    <statement>
    <statement>
```

## `if`...`elif`...`else` Statements

```python
if <condition>:
    <statement>
    <statement>
elif:
    <statement>
    <statement>
else:
    <statement>
    <statement>
```
