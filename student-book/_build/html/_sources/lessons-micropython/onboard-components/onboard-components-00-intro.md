# Introduction to the Onboard Components

The BBC micro:bit is a versatile microcontroller board designed for education, experimentation, and prototyping. It features a variety of onboard components that provide a wide range of capabilities for creating interactive projects and learning experiences.

Key onboard components of the micro:bit include:

1. **LED Matrix**: A 5x5 grid of individually addressable LEDs as the primary output interface for displaying text, symbols, animations, and graphical patterns.
2. **Buttons**: Two tactile buttons labeled as A and B, providing user input for triggering events, controlling functionality, and interacting with programs.
3. **Captive Touch Logo**: A touch-sensitive pad below the LED matrix allows for touch-based interactions and input detection.
4. **Accelerometer**: A sensor that detects changes in acceleration and orientation along three axes (X, Y, Z), enabling the micro:bit to sense movement, tilt, and orientation changes.
5. **Compass**: A sensor that detects the direction of the Earth's magnetic field, providing compass functionality and orientation sensing capabilities.
6. **Light Sensor**: A sensor that measures the intensity of ambient light in the surrounding environment, enabling the micro:bit to respond to changes in lighting conditions.
7. **Temperature Sensor**: A sensor that measures the ambient temperature, allowing the micro:bit to detect temperature changes and provide temperature-related functionality.
