- a Micro USB cable

## Instructions:

1. **Setup**: Connect your BBC micro:bit to your PC or laptop using the Micro USB cable.
2. **Programming Environment**: Open the BBC micro:bit programming environment on your PC or laptop.
3. **Display Your Name**:
   - Write a program to display your name on the BBC micro:bit’s LED display. Your name should scroll across the display from right to left.
   - Test your program by uploading it to the BBC micro:bit. Make sure your name scrolls correctly across the display.

4. **Display an Image**:

   - Modify your program to display an image of your choice on the LED display after your name has scrolled across the micro: bit display. You can use a predefined image or create your own.
