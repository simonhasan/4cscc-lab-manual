# Objectives

> - **Apply Concepts**: Students will be able to apply their understanding of the BBC micro:bitâ€™s display capabilities to create a digital nametag. They will demonstrate this by programming the micro:bit to display their name and a chosen image.
>
> - **Strategic Thinking**: Students will be able to troubleshoot and solve problems that arise during the programming process. They will demonstrate this by identifying errors in their code, hypothesizing solutions, and implementing these solutions to achieve the desired output.
>
> - **Reasoning**: Students will be able to explain the logic behind their code and how it results in the display of their name and image on the micro:bit. They will demonstrate this by writing a brief report or presenting to the class, explaining the steps they took in their programming process and the reasoning behind these steps.
