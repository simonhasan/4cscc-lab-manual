# Running Code on a micro:bit with MakeCode

The code in this section describes how to create a first program. The program displays the text "Hello!" and displays it on the micro:bit display once.

## Selecting and Adding Blocks

Click on the `Basic` section of the Toolbox.

Drag the `show string` block into the `on start` block.

The program is now complete.

## Handling Unused Blocks

Unused blocks can either be moved or deleted. Unused blocks do not generally have affect on the program if they are empty, but moving or deleting unused blocks prevents overlapping blocks and improves the readability of the code.

### Moving Unused Blocks

Unused blocks can be selected and moved.

Unused blocks can be deleted by dragging them to the left and releasing them on the Toolbox where the purple trash can appears.

Unused blocks can also be deleted by selecting the block and pressing the delete or backspace key on the upper right corner of the keyboard.

## Downloading Code to the micro:bit

After the `show string` block is placed in the `on start` block, it can be downloaded to the micro:bit. If the micro:bit is not connected, follow the steps in the previous section TODO:LINK.

After the "Download" button is pressed it is downloaded to the micro:bit.
