# Variables

In mathematics, a **variable** is a symbol or letter used to represent an unknown quantity or a value that can change within a given context or equation. Variables are typically denoted by letters such as $x$, $y$, or $z$â€‹, and their values can vary depending on the conditions or constraints of the problem being considered.

In computer science, a **variable** is a symbolic name associated with a memory location that stores data. Variables are placeholders for values that can change during a program's execution. They represent and manipulate different data types, such as numbers, strings, or objects, allowing programmers to work with dynamic information and perform computations. 

## Creating Variables with MakeCode

To create a variable, select "Variables" in the Toolbox, and selct "Make a Variable..."

A window prompts the user to name the variable. After naming the variable to "name", select "Ok."

The `name` variable is now available to use in "Variables" in the Toolbox.

## Assigning a Value to the Variable

By default, MakeCode variables are numbers, as seen with the `set name to 0` block below. This can be changed after the variable is dragged to the Workspace.

Drag the `set name to 0` block into the `on start` block into the `on start` block.

Select "Advanced" and "Text" in the Toolbox to set the variable to a string. Select the MakeCode string block <img src="assets/makecode-string-block.png" alt="makecode-string-block" width="30px" />. TODO:FIX THE IMAGE SIZE

Change the type of the `name` variable from a number to a blank string. Enter a name for the value of the `name` variable.

![makecode-variables-07](assets/makecode-variables-07.png)

In the "Basic" section of the Toolbox, selct a `show string` block. Drag it into the forever block.

![makecode-variables-08](assets/makecode-variables-08.png)

In the "Variables" section of the Toolbox, select the variable `name`.

![makecode-variables-09](assets/makecode-variables-09.png)

Drag the `name` variable in the `show string` block
