## The RGB Color Model

In the **RGB color model**, colors are represented as combinations of red (R), green (G), and blue light (B). Each color component can have an intensity value ranging from 0 to 255 or 1 byte, where 0 indicates no intensity (black), and 255 indicates full intensity (maximum brightness for that color component).

With 256 color combinations for each color in the RGB color model, there are 256Â³ or 16,777,216 possible color combinations
