**dynamically typed**: a programming language feature where variables can hold values of any data type, and the type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to it.

**immutable**: a property of certain objects that means they cannot be modified after they are created. Immutable objects in Python, such as strings, tuples, and numbers, retain their initial values throughout their lifetime and cannot be altered directly. 

**string**: a sequence of characters enclosed within either single (`' '`) or double (`" "`) quotation marks. Strings represent text-based data and are one of Python's most commonly used data types.

**variable**: a symbolic name representing or referring to a value stored in memory. Variables allow programmers to store and manipulate data within a program. 

**whitespace**: any non-visible character used for spacing, indentation, or formatting within code or text files. Examples of whitespace characters include spaces, tabs, and newline characters.
