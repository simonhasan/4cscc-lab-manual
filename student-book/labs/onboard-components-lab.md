# Lab: Building a Fidget Device with BBC micro:bit

## Objective:

In this lab, you will design and build a fidget device using the BBC micro:bit. Your device should have at least five different input/output reactions.

## Materials:

- a PC or Laptop
- a BBC micro:bit
- a Micro USB cable

## Inputs:

- Buttons
- Capacitive touch logo
- Accelerometer
- Temperature sensor
- Light sensor
- Sound sensor
- Compass

## Outputs:
- 5x5 LED matrix
- Buzzer

## Instructions:

1. **Setup**: Connect your BBC micro:bit to your PC or laptop using the Micro USB cable.
2. **Programming Environment**: Open the BBC micro:bit programming environment on your PC or laptop.
3. **Design your fidget device:** Sketch out a design for your fidget device. Think about how you can incorporate the inputs and outputs in an interactive and fun way.
4. **Code your device:** Using the MakeCode editor or Python editor for micro:bit, write code to control your device. Here are some ideas for input/output reactions:
   - When a button is pressed, display a pattern on the LED matrix.
   - When the device is shaken, make the buzzer sound.
   - When the light level changes, change the display on the LED matrix.
   - When a loud sound is detected, make the buzzer sound.
   - When the device is tilted, change the display on the LED matrix.
5. **Test your device:** After youâ€™ve written your code, download it to your micro:bit and test your device. Make sure all the inputs and outputs are working as expected.
6. **Document your work:** Take pictures or videos of your device in action. Write a brief report explaining your design process, how you coded your device, any challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.
7. **Present your work:** Prepare a short presentation to share your fidget device with the class. Demonstrate each input/output reaction and explain how you created it.
8. **Reflection**: Write a brief report explaining the logic behind your code and how it results in a fidget device with at least five input/output reactions.
