### Integers in Mathematics

In mathematics, integers are positive and negative whole numbers, along with zero. They are represented without fractional or decimal points. The set of integers denoted by $\Z$ includes all the negative and positive counting numbers:

$\Z = \{...-3, -2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ...\}$â€‹

Integers represent quantities that can be counted, such as the number of objects in a collection or the position of an object in a sequence. They are essential in various mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Integers in Python

In Python, integers (`int)`are an immutable data type used to represent whole numbers, both positive and negative, without any fractional or decimal components, as they do in mathematics. Integers in Python can be of arbitrary size, representing very large or very small numbers.

Integers are defined using numerical digits and can be assigned to variables or used directly in expressions. For example:

```python
x = 5
y = -2
number_of_students = 5
```
