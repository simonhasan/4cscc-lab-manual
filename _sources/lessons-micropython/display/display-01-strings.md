# The String (`str`) Data Type

Computers manipulate data. Data can come in several forms. Not all data is handled the same way, so information is organized into different types. The same set of operations can be used to manipulate the data within data types. Consider the following examples:

`100` is a number that can be used in mathematical computations. The `'100'` in the sentence, `I have 100 things in my mind.' ` Is part of a sequence of characters. A series of characters in computer science is called a **string**.
