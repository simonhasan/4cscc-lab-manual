# Digital and Analog Signals

TODO

**Digital signals** represent data as discrete binary values (0s and 1s). **Analog signals** represent data as continuous waves of varying amplitude or frequency. In the case of a micro:bit, an analog signal can be within the range of 0 and 1023 or between 0 and 255 (in certain circumstances). 

Possible plots for digital and analog signals are displayed below:
