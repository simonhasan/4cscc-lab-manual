# The micro:bit General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) Pins 

micro:bit has 19 assignable **general-purpose input/output (GPIO)** pins. These pins can be used as inputs for different switches and sensors. They can also control outputs like light-emitting diodes (LEDs), displays, buzzers, and motors. Some pins are designed to work with alligator clip leads, but others require breakout boards to access the pins.

## Alligator Clip Pins

As mentioned above, some of the pins on the micro:bit were designed to be used with 4mm alligator clip leads. Three of the pins can be utilized for input and outputs.

One of the pins can power sensors with 3.3 volts (3v3).

The other pin is used as a ground (GND) TODO
