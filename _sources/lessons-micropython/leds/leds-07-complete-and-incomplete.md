A: This is an incomplete circuit, because input/output pin is not connected to the same row the annode of the LED is connected to.<br>
B: This is an incomplete circuit, because the GND pin is not connected to the sane row as the jumper attached to the resistor.<br>
C: This is an incomplete circuit, because the annode is attached to the GND pin.<br>
