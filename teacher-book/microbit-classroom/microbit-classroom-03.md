# Using micro:bit Classroom with Python

## Starting a New micro:bit Classroom Session

Start a new session at [classroom.microbit.org](https://classroom.microbit.org/).

![microbit-classroom-01](assets/microbit-classroom-start-01.png)

The landing page has several new options. To start a new session, select "New blank session".

With Python selected, give the session an name and edit the starter code.

This will open up the Python editor in micro:bit classroom. 

Edit the starte code for the student.

:::{note}
Starter code facilitates the learning experience for students. There are times where code may complex and beyond the scope of the lesson. This helps students focus on the code necessary to complete the objectives of the lesson.

:::{tip}
Giving students directions as comments may help them understand the assignment more. It also demostrates a best practice of commenting code. Comments are lines of text that are not executed at runtime. They are meat to be read by the people. There are a few ways to comment code in Python:<br>

**Single Line Comments** (above or after lines of code) with a hash (`h`):<br>

`# This is a comment.`<br>

**Multi-lined comments** (between triple single quotes or triple double quotes):<br>

`'''
This
is a
multi-lined comment
'''`

`"""
This
is also a
multi-lined comment.
"""`
