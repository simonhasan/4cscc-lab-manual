Managing classroom assignments works best using [micro:bit Classroom](https://classroom.microbit.org/), a learning management system created by the Micro:bit Educational Foundation. Both Microsoft MakeCode and Python are supported by micro:bit classroom. This software allows teachers to:
- Assign students assignments with starter code as a group or individually.
- Monitor assignments in real-time.
- Assist students remotely.
- Download reports with student work.
- Save sessions to continue at a later date.
